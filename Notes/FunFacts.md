# Fun Facts
A collection of some of the best facts I found most interesting!

* IBM's quantum computers operate at around 0.15 kelvin which is colder than outer space (which averages around 2.7 kelvin)
* The term spooky action at a distance was coined by Einstein in reference to entanglement, which could have disproved this theory of relativity
* The complexity of unordered search is root N (where N is the number of elements), compared to N/2 on a classical computer
* Numbers used in RSA encryption can be broken down into their 2 primes factors with only 10d qubits (where d is the number of digits) in O(d^3 time)
* All classical gates that take 2 inputs and produce 1 output can be adapted to work with quantum computers - turning into gates with 3 inputs and 3 outputs
* Entangled particles can be used to teleport information faster than the speed of light! But in order to have any control over what is being sent, information must be sent along a classical channel to tell the recipient  how to recover the sent state and so faster than light communication is not possible (but teleportation is!)
* A classical computer would require 10^86 bit to simualte pencillin, which is a number larger than the number of atoms in the observable universe. A quantum computer however would require only 286 qubits
