# Fun Facts
A collection of some of the best facts I found most interesting!

* IBM's quantum computers operate at around 0.15 kelvin which is colder than outer space (which averages around 2.7 kelvin)
* The term spooky action at a distance was coined by Einstein in reference to entanglement, which could have disproved this theory of relativity
* The complexity of unordered search is root N (where N is the number of elements), compared to N/2 on a classical computer
* Numbers used in RSA encryption can be broken down into their 2 primes factors with only 10d qubits (where d is the number of digits) in O(d^3 time)
