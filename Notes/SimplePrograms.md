# Simple programs
When you start to link gates up together you can build up further operators or programs.

## Swapping the states of two qubits
This score swaps the states of 2 qubits. I would recommend working through the inputs and outputs with a piece of paper, just to get your head around how it works (and that it does actually work!).

It is worth noting that in the real device this cannot be done between all pairs of qubits because not all pairs are linked.

There are further examples [here](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/tutorial?sectionId=full-user-guide&page=004-Quantum_Algorithms~2F061-Basic_Circuit_Identities_and_Larger_Circuits).
