Most images and information come from the [IBMQ beginners tutorial](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/tutorial?sectionId=beginners-guide&page=introduction) and [Mermin's book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Quantum-Computer-Science-David-Mermin/dp/0521876583). Once you have read the beginners tutorial, the [user guide](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/tutorial?sectionId=full-user-guide&page=introduction) is a good next step. [A good textbook](http://www-reynal.ensea.fr/docs/iq/QC10th.pdf) which starts from a very basic level.

This is a [very helpful paper](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/darmon/courses/12-13/nt/projects/Fangxi-Lin.pdf) for the notation and QFT.
